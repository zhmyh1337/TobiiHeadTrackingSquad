Tobii head tracking integration with Squad game. Can be used with any other game as well. Translates the data from Tobii head tracking sensors to mouse movement. Main file is `MyNewMain.cpp`. The settings can be changed there. You need to enable Tobii sensor first (the LED on the webcam should light up). Mouse moves only when cursor is disabled (so, normal gameplay). No memory injections in game and other spooky stuff.
